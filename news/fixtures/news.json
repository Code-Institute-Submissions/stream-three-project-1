Externally, Rodmell had numerous broken bones and his right arm and leg were nearly crushed.</p>\r\n<p>\"Ellis has been stabilized and he's out of immediate danger,\" said team doctor Rhys Kerswell, who has maintained contact with attending surgeons. \"Still, the next 24-48 hours are going to be crucial. They need to make sure all of his organs are functioning properly.\"</p>\r\n<p>Rodmell was airlifted from his rural farm to the hospital, which is 30 miles away. Doctors indicated that quick thinking by his wife and children likely saved Rodmell's life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Bulls released a statement today that read, \"Our thoughts and prayers are with Ellis and his family at this time. We are confident in the medical treatment he is receiving and optimistic that Ellis will make a full recovery.</p>",

You just don't come back from injuries like these at his age to play professionally again.\"</p>\r\n<p>While teammates expressed relief that Rodmell was doing better, many were devastated upon hearing that his playing days were finished. \"It's just so unfair,\" lamented teammate Juan Crespi. \"Ellis is such a great guy.

Most players drafted in thirty days won't be on a big league club for years, if at all.</p>\n<p>Some will languish listlessly at the minor league level. Others will suffer a series of misfortunes, never quite making their mark, but always wowing scouts with their potential. And yet, some lucky team will draw a needle out of a haystack, send him off to the minors and forget about him for a while, only to realize they've got a Hall of Famer on their hands.</p>\n<p>At any rate, teams now have thirty days to scout the draft pool prior to the draft. The Transactions page also gets a new section dedicated to the pool.</p>\n<p>The top players available (in no particular order) seem to be:</p>\n<p>1. Todd Panton, 19 year-old CF out of high-school.<br />2. David MacRae, 19 year-old RF out of college.<br />3. Bradley Buckeridge, 18 year-old RHP out of high-school.<br />4. Roy Boatwright, 20 year-old CF out of college.<br />5. Ciaran Burdon, 20 year-old RF out of college.<br />6. Charles Farrell, 21 year-old CF out of college.<br />7.

        "content": "<p>On Friday night I was feeling a little bit more optimistic about our season. Not like me really, but we had won three games out of four and managed to grind out a good win against a tricky Dublin side. The events of the last two days have changed all that good feeling though. We just can't play well enough on a consistent basis against the middle of the pack teams to be able to sustain a good season.</p>\n<p>Although we were behind heading into the ninth inning yesterday, we were still well in the game only for the bullpen to crumble yet again. Cranidge really looked like he just did not want to be out there. Still, we responded well today and overall I would have been happy with a win - Dublin have got a decent team and to take two out of three would have been a good weekend. With the 6-3 lead late on, we should have been home and dry but Kirbishley just fell apart.</p>\n<p>It was a relief to take it into extra innings, but there was a real inevitability about losing the game in the dead of night the way we did. 8-10 at this stage of the season is probably a fair reflection of the way that we have played, but it's not a reflection of where we should be. We are underachieving again and it's largely down to the pitching staff. We are getting into winning positions, but we just can't convert them with the regularity that we should be able to.</p>\n<p>Something needs to be done about it, it's too late for this season but with a few changes in the pitching line up we could challenge next year - maybe!</p>",

Cardiff had somehow managed to drag themselves ahead of us in the standings, which I think says far more about how poor we have been this season than it does about them. Cardiff are a poor team themselves, and we should be way ahead of them really, something which I think today illustrated quite clearly.</p>\r\n<p>Even though we scored one in the first inning, I never expected the explosion of runs over the next four frames. Leading 19-2 at the end of the fifth, anyone who arrived late must have thought the scoreboard had malfunctioned again! Admittedly Cardiff helped us a lot with some dreadful fielding, but you have to make the hits and we showed that the offensive side of our team can compete with anyone in the league on their day.</p>\r\n<p>All the old frailities were there again at the end though - in a tight game giving up three runs in the eighth like that could have cost us yet again. Yes it was fun to watch a game like this, but we can't get carried away. The opposition was dreadful and we still allowed them six runs. At least we're back ahead of them in the standings though, it was frankly embarrassing to be sitting below a team who can perform as badly as this!</p>",

It's going to get harder from here on, we play Liverpool next weekend and of course they were the team who took our title away last year. I'm sure they enjoyed the reversal of fortunes, but we will enjoy it just as much when we overtake them again this time!</p>\r\n<p>They will probably be the biggest opposition we face in the Northern Conference this year, so next weekend's series will give us a good idea of where we stand against them.

Beating Liverpool 13-1 was OK too! Having lost seven of the last eight games in pre-season though, it's tough to go into the regular season feeling good about our chances. We lost too many close games, and although you might say at least we were in with a chance, I just feel it says more about our inability to come through with the big hits when it matters.</p>\r\n<p>There will be teams with worse pitching than us, and teams with worse hitting than us, but I'm just struggling to have much faith in our ability to pull out the wins in close games.
