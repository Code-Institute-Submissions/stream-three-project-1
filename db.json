Cranidge really looked like he just did not want to be out there. Still, we responded well today and overall I would have been happy with a win - Dublin have got a decent team and to take two out of three would have been a good weekend. With the 6-3 lead late on, we should have been home and dry but Kirbishley just fell apart.</p>\n<p>It was a relief to take it into extra innings, but there was a real inevitability about losing the game in the dead of night the way we did. 8-10 at this stage of the season is probably a fair reflection of the way that we have played, but it's not a reflection of where we should be. We are underachieving again and it's largely down to the pitching staff. We are getting into winning positions, but we just can't convert them with the regularity that we should be able to.</p>\n<p>Something needs to be done about it, it's too late for this season but with a few changes in the pitching line up we could challenge next year - maybe!</p>",

With the bases loaded in the eighth I though it was about to happen, but perhaps we were hoping for too much.</p>\r\n<p>We reach half-way at 10-19 - honestly, we should be several games better than that and anyone who has seen our games this season will surely agree. There's not much chance of us getting out of last place in the North, but we're a better team than Cardiff so surely we won't end up with the worst record in the whole league. We deserve better than that.</p>",

The first one was the closest, getting back to the Championship Series only to lose in five games to Birmingham, but this time I think it might be different.

Retaking the lead 11-10 almost immediately was certainly a shock! Getting through three innings with a one-run lead is tough for the Dragons though, especially with a rain delay to deal with, and having got so close it was heartbreaking to see Birmingham tie it right at the end.</p>\r\n<p>The team stuck at the task though and although&nbsp;Fran&ccedil;ois Toussaint will get the headlines for his five hits, Dermott Woolton deserves a huge share of the credit for a massive two out hit in the eleventh.

        "content": "<p>Having won 15 of our first 20 games this season, I don't think anyone expected to see the Rhinos swept by London in three games. It shouldn't have happened either, as some very uncharacteristic late inning struggles cost us very dearly in all three games.</p>\r\n<p>Letting slip the lead in the ninth inning on Friday was disappointing, but at least it was only a one-run lead in a tight game which saw the Kings out hit us anyway. Leading 4-2 in the 7th on Saturday, we should have been able to see that one through but Lee Pell's pitching was poor - I'm not really convinced that he is up to the job of pitching in this league on a regular basis. If we have a big lead maybe, but not in a close game.</p>\r\n<p>Yesterday was the worst one of all though. Up 5-0 in the second, we looked to be cruising and I think the players thought so as well. We took our foot off the gas, threw a couple of careless pitches to O'Merry and he punished us. It was a game we should have won, and we don't usually throw away positions like that. Maybe at 15-5 we were getting a bit complacent and assuming we could just beat teams easily - this could be the wake-up we needed!</p>",

I've seen pitchers go longer than five innings without giving up a hit, but lose the no-hitter because the game is, understandably, still going on. It's not the pitcher's fault that it rains, and the game can't be completed, but on the other hand it isn't really up with the achievements of pitchers who have got through the full nine innings without giving up a hit.</p>\r\n<p>I'll still enjoy having seen it happen, but I think I'll be even more excited when I finally see a no-hitter that has lasted the full nine innings.</p>",

When we lost seven of our first ten games, things weren't looking good but some really good pitching all around has started to turn round our season. Today, McGregor gave us the best example of that yet!</p>\r\n<p>Only allowing four baserunners across eight innings, and only two of those from base hits, was a magnificent performance from a player who some of the 'experts' would have had you believe was past his best. I thought it was a shame that he wasn't allowed to go back out for the ninth to try to get the complete game shutout, but to be fair he had thrown nearly 120 pitches. Five or so years ago, maybe, but probably better to protect his arm now.</p>\r\n<p>Having had a bad start, I think it's already too late for us to be thinking about the possibility of competing with Birmingham this year, which is disappointing after how close we ran them last year. I think we look good to be able to finish second in the conference this season though - if we can do that and finish with a winning record too, it would be a good platform to build from for next year.</p>",

Losing seven of our last nine games is bad enough, but to drop a game like yesterday's defeat to Cardiff was just dreadful. Thanks to the rain, we haven't even had a chance to make up for it today.</p>\r\n<p>To be fair, yesterday's game really could have gone either way but having got the 2-0 lead thanks to two runs in the ninth, we should have been able to hold on. Giving up a lead-off home run is never a good sign in that situation, it brought the Cardiff fans right back into the game and gave their players hope that they could get back into the game.</p>\r\n<p>I thought the Kings might just get away with it when we got the next two outs, but Julian Murcott just threw a bad pitch to Chantler and got punished for it. Even though there were two out, there was something inevitable about the Dragons getting the winning run after that. I'm not really sure why Murcott stayed in the game, his head didn't seem to be in the right place, but he never looked like getting either of the next two hitters out and the Dragons got the win.</p>\r\n<p>The way things are going, we will be lucky to avoid finishing last this year - which is something I never thought I'd say after a good season last year and a great run in Spring Training this year.</p>",

If we could just score a few more runs, things might be different. Our pitching is right up there with the best in the league, but to only score 85 runs in 29 games this season just isn't good enough.</p>\r\n<p>Dean O'Merry was a really good signing for us, and has already helped us to win a couple of games that we might otherwise have lost, but we need a couple more like him if we are to get ahead of Bristol and stay ahead.
