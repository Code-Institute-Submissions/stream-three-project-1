# Code Institute Stream Three Project

This is a project website for the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development course Stream Three. The project is a
website for a sports league, and has been constructed around a fictional baseball league, the data for which was
generated using the game "Out of the Park Baseball 18". The site is built using the Django framework and incorporates
elements which are common to sports league websites, such as news stories, game results and fixtures, information about
teams, and the ability for fans to interact and purchase premium content or merchandise. The site is presented as it
would look midway through a season, with data generated up to early July in the 2018 season.
